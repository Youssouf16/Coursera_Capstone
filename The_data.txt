The data

For solving our problem, these are the keys datas we will use:
- number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)
- number of and distance to Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, if any
- distance of neighborhood from city center

To have these data we will start from:
- Neighborhood Address
- Latitude
- Longitude
- UTM(X)
- UTM(Y)

These data are available through :
- Google Maps API geocoding and reverse geocoding to generate centers of candidate areas and approximate distance of neighborhood from city center. geocoding will be used to generate coordinates.
- Foursquare API to get number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood
